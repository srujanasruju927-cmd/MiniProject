The Laser-Based Border Security System is a modern surveillance technology used to protect border areas from unauthorized entry. 
The system uses a continuous laser beam directed toward a sensor. When an intruder crosses the laser line, the beam is interrupted, triggering an alarm or alert message.
This system offers a low-cost, reliable, and efficient solution for securing long border areas, military zones, and restricted boundaries.

✔ Intrusion Detection

Instant detection of any interruption in the laser beam.

✔ Long-Range Coverage

Laser beams travel long distances, making them suitable for borders.

✔ Low Cost & Efficient

Uses simple components with high effectiveness.

✔ Real-Time Alerts

Triggers buzzer, siren, or sends SMS/IoT alerts to security officers.

✔ High Accuracy

Laser lines provide precise and straight detection points.
